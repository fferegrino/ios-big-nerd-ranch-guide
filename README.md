# ios-big-nerd-ranch-guide
So I bought the [OS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (6th Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/ios-programming/) book and I'm doing the excercises using Xamarin.iOS.   

## This is almost as fun as [Learning Xamarin.iOS at Stanford Universiy](http://thatcsharpguy.com/post/learning-xamarin-ios-stanford-cs193p/)
